# JWT implementation using Crypto - without hitting `npm install` 

Implementing JWT equivalent from scratch. I know this might sound redundant, why does it even exist when you can pretty much get away with using `npm i jsonwebtoken`.

Well, this is a part of my [_**"Building stuff in Vanilla NodeJS without installing any external packages"**_](https://x.com/sahil_singh37/status/1759523537402868217?s=20) challenge, I know that's a mouthful for a challenge's name, but who cares.

In this I try to build non-trivial stuff using raw NodeJS, nothing else.

## Why does it exist?

This challenge is to encourage depth and problem solving in programmers, rather than picking someone else's package and using it mechanically.
